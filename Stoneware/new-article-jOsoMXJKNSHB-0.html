<h1>The Newport Historic Spring Archaeological Site's Origin</h1><p>When developments for Newport's Spring Park began, old gas containers needed to be removed from the ground due to the site being home to gasoline stations in the past. In digging up the gas rigs, several artifacts were uncovered including this brown salt glazed stoneware which was the first artifact discovered. The uncovering of these artifacts is what led to the excavation of the Newport Historic Spring.</p><p><img src="Coffee Site.jpg" width="429" height="283" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-mce-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p><p><sub>48 Touro Street, Newport RI.
