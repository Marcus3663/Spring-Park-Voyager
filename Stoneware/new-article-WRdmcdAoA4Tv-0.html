<h1>Origins of Salt Glazing</h1><p>The earliest known production of salt glazed stoneware comes from the Rhineland of Germany around 1400 CE. Salt glazing would be practiced in England after the mid-1600s and the English potter John Dwight was well known for his variations of this technique in his attempt to imitate Rhenish Brown Stoneware. Dwight perfected his technique around 1675 and salt glazing would find its way to the American colonies with immigrant German and English potters. And a good proportion of early American colonial pottery is salt glazed.</p>
