<h1>Brown Salt Glazing</h1><p>The method of salt glazing stoneware involves throwing salt into a kiln during the higher temperature part of the firing process when making pottery. Sodium from the salt reacts with silica in the clay body to form a glassy coating of sodium silicate, which may be colorless or colored based on any chemicals used. In the case of brown salt glazed stoneware, iron oxide is added to the firing process which results in the uncolored glaze changing into shades of brown. And pottery pieces were typically dipped in a brown slip, during the manufacturing process, which covered all or part of the vessel and resulted in the brown slip having a more or less "speckled" appearance (as shown on this artifact).&nbsp;</p>
